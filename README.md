# Edward(Aries)'s README

My name's Edward Chang, though I usually go by Aries. I’m a software engineer who builds scalable systems that directly improve product performance and user experience. I’ve led and contributed to engineering efforts across early-stage startups and high-traffic platforms with 4+ million users, shipping features like matching algorithms, email marketing integrations, and real-time chat systems.

## About me

I was born in Los Angeles, CA, and spent my childhood in both Schaumburg, IL and Seoul, Korea. I studied Computer Science at UCLA and chose to leave school after my second year to gain early industry experience — a decision that allowed me to grow quickly through hands-on work in dynamic startup environments. I began my professional career in Seoul at fast-paced tech startups and have since relocated to the United States to continue growing as an engineer in the U.S. tech industry.

## How I work

- I believe in collaboration and knowledge-sharing. I’m always eager to learn from others and contribute where I can.
- I start by deeply understanding the problem before jumping into solutions. Once there’s clarity, I move with focus and intent.
- I prioritize execution. Once the direction is set, I move fast and iterate with purpose.

## What I'm Working On

Recently, I've been expanding into AI product development — learning GenAI and building projects that combine real-time systems with intelligent automation. My goal is to engineer the next generation of software that’s not only reliable and scalable, but also delivers intelligent, adaptive user experiences.

## Personal life

Outside of work, I’m passionate about fitness. I’ve completed several full marathons, including a sub-3-hour finish at the Chicago Marathon. These days, I'm also into indoor climbing and calisthenics.
