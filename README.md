# Edward's README

My name's Edward and I'm an experienced Ruby on Rails Developer. This README provides a quick overview of me and how I work.  

## About me

- I was born in Los Angeles, CA. I spent my childhood years in both Schaumburg, IL and Seoul, Korea.
- I studied Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).
- After my second year in university, I decided to leave school to gain hands-on experience in the industry early, and this decision has allowed me to develop a versatile skill set.
- I started my professional career in Seoul, Korea at prosperous tech startups.
- I have now relocated to the United States (Los Angeles, CA) to further my career.

## How I work

- I believe in teamwork and collaboration, and I'm always open to sharing insights or learning from others.
- Before jumping into a solution, I make sure I understand the underlying causes of an issue. Once I have clarity, I create a plan and work efficiently to implement it.
- I prefer actions over words. Once I have a clear path forward, I focus on execution.

## Personal life

- I am passionate about fitness. I have completed full marathons several times, including Sub 3 hour run at the Chicago Marathon.
- I love being out in nature and occasionally take time to refresh on weekends, breathing in fresh air out in the open.
